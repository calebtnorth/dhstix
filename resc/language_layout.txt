language needs to have
data storage
data manipulation
i/o
flow control

# data storage
similar to bf with the whole linear array concept but it
starts at a single entry and expands dynamically
|  || moves the pointer right
||  | moves the pointer left

# data manipulation
variables are incremented, decremented, or storage
| ||| increments the current value
||| | decrements the current value
||||| set the current value to the next contiguous block of pipes

# io
  ||| outputs the current value
|||   takes pipe count as input

# flow control 
|| || runs the commands to the next || || if the current value is not zero
